Dr. Morgan spent 10 years as an Assistant Professor and Associate then at Washington State University, before joining the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in 2005. At the Hutch, Dr. Morgan worked on the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data; which he has led since 2008. Dr. Morgan recently moved to Roswell Park in Buffalo Comprehensive Cancer Center, NY, where the Bioconductor project is now based.

Special Interests:

* Statistical methods in computational biology
* Analysis and comprehension of ‘next generation’ high-throughput sequence data
* Integrative analysis of large-scale multiple ‘omics data sets
* Inference of single-cell evolutionary processes in cancer development
