Hi !!! I Studied Food Technology at UIA and my masters and PhD in Biotechnology and Bioengineering at CINVESTAV. I've have had several years in postdocs and jobs at many Institutions (ECOSUR, UNSIJ, INIFAP, CONABIO, UAM-X). I'm interested in numerical ecology, data visualization and agrobiodiversity. Finally, I practice touring bike and admire Thomas Bernhard, WG Sebald and Glenn Gould.
