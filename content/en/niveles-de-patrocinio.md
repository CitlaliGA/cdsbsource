If you want to sponsor us please get in touch: [**cdsbmexico@gmail.com**](mailto:cdsbmexico@gmail.com). Thank you!

### Why you should support us?

[CDSB](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/) and [TIBs](http://congresos.nnb.unam.mx/) are workshops held yearly in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico in a week chosen such that students, faculty, and industry employees across the country are more likely to be able to travel and attend the workshops. Workshop participants come from all over the country (and abroad) representing a unique opportunity to reach budding bioinformatics talent from many states without having to travel to them. From 2010 to 2019, participants came from an average of 18/32 (56%) different Mexican states and 4 countries, with a mean of 80 students and 49 academia or industry employees per event. The workshop organizers and core instructors are seasoned veterans that have received positive reviews from participants across the years. By sponsoring these workshops you will have the opportunity to __help train and recruit talent for your institution__. The workshops are jointly organized by the [National Bioinformatics Node (NNB in Spanish)](http://www.nnb.unam.mx/) and the [Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers (CDSB in Spanish)](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/) with the logistical support by the [Mexican Bioinformatics Network (RMB in Spanish)](https://www.redmexicanadebioinformatica.org/). All events follow a [code of conduct](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/codigo-de-conducta/) designed to foster a welcoming environment for everyone involved.
