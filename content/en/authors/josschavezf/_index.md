With bachelor formation as Engineer in Biotechnology by the National Polytechnic Institute from Mexico ([IPN](http://www.upiig.ipn.mx/)), I started my scientific career studying Plant Epigenetics in [CINVESTAV](http://www.ira.cinvestav.mx/), then I made a master in the [Biotechnology Institute](http://www.ibt.unam.mx/) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico ([UNAM](http://www.unam.mx/)) focus on Drosophila Epigenetics. During the master studies I began to take some basic R courses with statistics and plotting orientation that woke up my interest in bioinformatics and programming.

As current PhD Student, in Merinoâ€™s [Lab](http://www.ibt.unam.mx/server/PRG.base?tipo:doc,dir:PRG.grupo,par:Gep,tit:_Grupo_del__Dr._Enrique_Merino) I am developing a bioinformatic project focus on the analysis of transcriptional regulators from bacteria, especially in the PVC (Planctomycetes-Chlamydiae-Verrucomicrobia) superphylum. I am interested in the evolutionary origin of transcriptional regulatory networks from bacteria and archea that lead to the eukaryotic gene regulation as we known it at present.
