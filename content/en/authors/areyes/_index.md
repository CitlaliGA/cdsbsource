I am a Data Scientist for Early Drug Development at Novartis Institute for BioMedical Research. I develop computational strategies to translate large amounts of data into biological knowledge. I implement my analyses in documented workflows, software packages and graphic interphases. I am a contributor of software to the Bioconductor project.
