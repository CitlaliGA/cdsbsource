[Elisa](http://emarquezz.github.io/) integrates multiple omics and phenotypic data with genome-scale metabolic modeling  for rational strain design and bioprocess optimization project as part of his work at [CCG](https://www.libd.org/) with [Utrilla Lab](https://sites.google.com/ccg.unam.mx/utrillalab/home). She is interested in the integration of different types of data such as RNA-seq, proteomics, Ribo-seq and fitness information, with metabolism and expression models built with the`python` module [COBRAme](https://cobrame.readthedocs.io/en/master/). Her objective is to make a quantitative comparison between genome and proteome reduction strategies for redirecting cellular resources to synthetic functions.
