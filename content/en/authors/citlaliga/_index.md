I studied genomic sciences at UNAM. I'd worked on various projects focused on population genetics and evolution. Some of my current interests are: philosophy, programming (R, python and trying arduino), science communication ( [Más ciencia por México](https://twitter.com/MasCienciaMx) ), I really love teaching and learning from others.
