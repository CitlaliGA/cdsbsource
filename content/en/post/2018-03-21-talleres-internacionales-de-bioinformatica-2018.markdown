**The National Node of Bioinformatics (NNB-UNAM) and the Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers (CDSB) invite you to**


### TIB2018: R para todos
### &
### Latin American R/Bioconductor Developers Workshop




**UNAM Center for Genomic Sciences (CCG-UNAM) in Cuernavaca Morelos, Mexico.**
**From July 30 to August 3, 2018**


This year, we decided to join efforts to promote the development of skills in the programming language R, under the slogan  **"Learn R and do community"** .

In the world of data analysis  **R**  and  **Python**  they are positioned as programming languages fastest growing.

The reasons:

* They are easy to learn

* Specialized libraries offer advanced statistics.


Why have we chosen R?

It is ideal for  **non - programmers**  and has really powerful libraries.

Our teachers are researchers, postdocs and academic technicians with extensive experience in the area of ​​domestic and foreign institutions. Most of them are certified as Software Carpentry certified instructors, who trained in the best practices of teaching computer science research.

The workshops are organized by:

 	
  * NNB-UNAM, Mexican node EMBNet (European Molecular Biology network)

 	
  * Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers (CDSB)
