The Community of Software Developers in Bioinformatics (CDSB) is committed to providing a welcoming and free experience harassment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race , ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof) or technology options. We do not tolerate harassment of participants of the conference in any way. Language and sexual images are not suitable for any place of the conference, including lectures, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Workshop participants who violate these rules may be punished or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers of the workshop.

This code of conduct applies to all participants, including staff and leadership of CDSB, and applies to all modes of interaction, both in person and online, including project repositories CDSB GitHub and CDSB GitHub, forum discussions CDSB, Slack channels and Twitter.

CDSB participants accept:

* Be considered in speech and actions, actively seek to recognize and respect the boundaries of others in attendance.
* Refrain from behaviors and degrading expressions, discriminatory or harassing. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photo or recording; sustained or deliberate interruption of the talks and other events; inappropriate physical contact; use of sexual imagery or discriminatory comments or jokes; and unwanted sexual attention. If you feel someone has harassed or treated him inappropriately, please report in person to any member of the organizing committee of the workshop.
* Take care of each other. Contact a member of the organizing committee of the workshop if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

**Need help?**

If you have any questions or concerns, talk to Heladia Salgado, Alejandro Reyes, Alejandra Medina-Rivera or Leonardo Collado Torres.

If any of the assistants engages in bullying behavior, the workshop organizers can take any legal action we deem appropriate, including, among others, warn the accused or ask the offender to leave the workshop. (If you feel you have been unjustly accused of violating this code of conduct, you must contact the organizing committee of the workshop with a brief description of your complaint).

We welcome your comments on this and all other aspects of CDSB events, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, pleasant and friendly experience for all involved.
